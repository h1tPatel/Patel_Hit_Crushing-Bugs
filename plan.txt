Problem 1: Allowing multiple puzzle pieces in one drop zone
Solution:
1. Analyzing the problem:
   - Currently, the game allows multiple puzzle pieces to be dropped into a single drop zone, which is not intended behavior.
   - We need to ensure that each drop zone can only contain one puzzle piece at a time.

2. Plan for the solution:
   - Modify the `handleDrop` function to check if the drop zone already contains a puzzle piece before appending a new one.
   - If the drop zone is not empty, remove the existing puzzle piece from the drop zone and reparent it back to the puzzle pieces container.
   - Then, append the dragged puzzle piece to the drop zone as before.

3. Implementation steps:
   - Inside the `handleDrop` function:
     - Check if the drop zone already contains a puzzle piece using `this.children.length > 0`.
     - If the drop zone is not empty:
       - Store the existing puzzle piece as a separate variable.
       - Remove the existing puzzle piece from the drop zone using `this.removeChild(existingPiece)`.
       - Append the existing puzzle piece back to the puzzle pieces container using `puzzlePiecesContainer.appendChild(existingPiece)`.
     - Finally, append the dragged puzzle piece to the drop zone using `this.appendChild(draggedPiece)`.

4. Test the solution:
   - Run the game and test dragging multiple puzzle pieces into a single drop zone.
   - Verify that only one puzzle piece remains in the drop zone while others are reparented back to the puzzle pieces container.

Problem 2: Puzzle pieces appearing in drop zones on reset/choosing a new puzzle
Solution:
1. Analyzing the problem:
   - Currently, when resetting or selecting a new background image, the puzzle pieces that were already in the drop zones remain there.
   - We need to ensure that on reset or new image selection, the puzzle pieces are removed from the drop zones and reparented back to the puzzle pieces container.

2. Plan for the solution:
   - Add functionality to the `resetPuzzlePieces` function to remove puzzle pieces from drop zones and reparent them back to the puzzle pieces container.
   - Call the `resetPuzzlePieces` function when the "Reset" button is clicked or a new background image is selected.

3. Implementation steps:
   - Update the `resetPuzzlePieces` function:
     - Iterate over each drop zone using a loop or `forEach` method.
